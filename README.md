# NYC Property Sales EDA 
Exploratory Data Analysis of rolling property sales data in NYC from March 2024-2025

## About 
The New York City Department of Finance maintains detailed public records of sales information for properties sold within NYC on an annualized basis since 2003, where detailed transaction metrices such as location, sale price, building class types and floor area are listed.

The objective of this project is to analyze and answer the following questions: 

- What are the most popular neighborhoods for homebuyers in terms of transactions?
- What are the trends in transacted property types and their median price?
- What are the most and least expensive neighborhoods for property buying in NYC?

For the purposes of data exploration, only data from a 24-month period of March 2023 to March 2025 will be used, with findings deployed on a Streamlit app.
